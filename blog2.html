        <h1>Goa Trip: A Dil Chahta Hai Vibe</h1>
        <p>This trip to Goa was like living in a scene from <em>Dil Chahta Hai</em>. Just like the trio of Akash, Sameer and Sid, we set off to make memories in the land of sun, sand, and sea. Each day brought with it new adventures, laughter, and moments that we’ll cherish forever.</p>

        <!-- Day 1 -->
        <h2>Day 1: Arrival at Palolem – The Calm Before the Chaos</h2>
        <p>Much like the first moments in <em>Dil Chahta Hai</em>, our journey started with excitement and adventure. We arrived in Madgaon, grabbed a rental car, and headed straight to Palolem Beach. The hostel we stayed at was just a short walk from the coast, and before long, we were indulging in Italian cuisine at Bridge Inn—probably something Akash would have chosen himself.</p>

        </div>
        <p>We spent the rest of the day walking along the coastline, capturing the beauty of the setting sun—Akash's impulsive nature coming through as we enjoyed the simple joys of life.</p>

        <!-- Day 2 -->
        <h2>Day 2: Kayaking Adventures at Cola Beach – Living in the Moment</h2>
        <p>We kicked off the day with a delicious breakfast at Caesar’s Café, run by two enthusiastic early teens from Tuscany. Then came the adventure—kayaking at Cola Beach, gliding through the serene backwaters. Much like the moments of reflection Sid has in the film, this experience reminded us to appreciate the beauty around us.</p>
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <p>We ended the day at Cabo de Rama, a stunning location that Sid would have surely painted. The sunset here felt like a moment straight out of the movie—stunning, peaceful, and unforgettable.</p>

        <!-- Day 3 -->
        <h2>Day 3: Solitude at Cabo de Rama – Reflecting like Sid</h2>
        <p>This was a <em>Siddharth</em> day for me. I set off alone to Cabo de Rama for a quiet morning, with the calm sea and the sound of the wind for company. It was a peaceful moment of reflection, much like Sid’s deep introspective moments in the film.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://github.com/rohandoijode/rohandoijode.github.io/raw/main/src/Cafe.jpeg" alt="Morning at Cabo de Rama">

        </div>
        <p>Later, we headed to Benaulim Beach, where live music filled the air at Johncy’s Café. The guitar and violin tunes felt like they belonged in Sameer’s playlist, making for a perfect afternoon. The evening ended with a stunning fire-breathing show at Southern Deck, where we enjoyed the lively atmosphere before heading back.</p>

        <!-- Day 4 -->
        <h2>Day 4: Farewell to Goa – Bittersweet Goodbyes</h2>
        <p>Like the end of <em>Dil Chahta Hai</em>, our last day in Goa was bittersweet. We returned the rental car, packed our bags, and boarded the train back to Panvel. Although the trip was over, the memories of the sunsets, laughter, and adventures will stay with us forever.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://github.com/rohandoijode/rohandoijode.github.io/raw/main/src/Boat.jpeg" alt="Returning the Rental Car">
        </div>
        <p>Goa has once again left its mark on us, and much like Akash, Sameer, and Sid, we left with a silent promise to return one day.</p>
